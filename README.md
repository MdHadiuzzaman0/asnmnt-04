getElementById() is used to detect 'id' in html file. It gives a single element, not array type data. It is the fatest detecting  method.

getElementsByClassName is used to detect all 'class' elements presented in html file. It provides a HTML collection, which is an array like object and changed itself with changing in html file.

querySelector is used to detect any css selector. It returns always first matching element.

querySelectorAll is kind of similar to getElementsByClassName. But it is used for any css selector, not only class elements. It provide a Nodelist which is a static collection.

a. Create element  ->      const child = document.createElement("div")

b. Add content ->              child.innerText = "hello world" / child.innerHTML = `<p>hello world</p>`

c. Add into DOM ->         parent.append(child)

Event bubbling is a process where event is operated from the target element up to its parents. It has three stages: Capture stage, Target stage, Bubbling stage.
In this process, the event starts at the document root and travels to the target element. Then event reaches the target point and bubbles up to its parent. Suppose a button is in a div. When anyone clicks on the button, the click event first triggers on the button, then bubbles up to the div, then body, then the document.

Instead of adding an event listener to each child element, we can use a single listener on the parent to easily catch the events. This is done using 'Event Delegation' procedure. It saves memory because  less code will be written and it also allows us to handle many dynamic elements easily and efficiently.



5.

stopPropagation() is used to stop the event from bubbling  further up the DOM.

preventDefault() is used to stop the default action of the element. Suppose I click a button, the browser know I clicked, but as we use preventDefault(), we cannot travel another page or another section.
